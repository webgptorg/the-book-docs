# We build the future

>The hottest new programming language is English.
>
> -- *Andrej Karpathy*

We believe that in the near future, should we have the Artificial General Intelligence or not, the key to succesfully
harness the potential of automating the routine process in engineering, we will need a shift in paradigm.
Only if we integrate machine learning into software engineering seamlessly and effectively, we can make some progress.

## Our vision

Our effort is motivated by several factors. First, similarly, to what [Appiary](https://apiary.io/) did some 15 
years ago, we believe the future is in the **specs.** Second, we believe more and more programmers will be needed in 
the near future, who won't be using any specific programming language, but a clearly written, human-like language, that 
will be **compiled** to executable code. Entire applications will be built in this way and we prepare the ecosystem 
ffor that.

## Our mission

We are standing on several legs. The following pipeline kind of illustrates the three main pillars:

As developers and innovators, we are at the forefront of this mission. The challenges many face â€“ from being
overwhelmed by the complexities of 'no-code' or 'low-code' platforms to the draining distractions of coordinating
with multiple stakeholders in traditional application development -- are the problems we aim to solve.

## Contribution Guideline

To be able to contribute, you should know several things.

### How is this documentation built

This site, built with [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/) and [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), should serve
as the only source of truth for our co-workers helping us to achieve the [above goals](#we-build-the-future). It is intended
to comply with the principles of [handbook-first approach](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first/),
instilling the asynchronous culture of work and communication, remote-first mindset and foster the potential for
automation of processes.
